# DevOps Resume Versioning

This project demonstrates version control of a resume using Git.  
The goal is to simulate real-world DevOps practices such as:

- Creating and managing branches
- Committing resume updates as versions
- Tagging release-ready versions
- Collaborating via pull requests and merges

This project showcases my Git skills while versioning my professional resume.

## Features

- Resume versioning using Git
- Git branches for different resume updates (skills, experience, etc.)
- Git tags to mark release versions (v1.0, v2.0)
- Collaboration simulation (PRs, merges, rebase, and conflict handling)

## Usage

You can clone this repo and explore the Git history to see how the resume evolved over time.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/devops-resume-versioning.git
